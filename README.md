🎤 Comical AI: CBAM Spot Hopper MVP

Welcome to Comical AI, the sidekick every up-and-coming Manhattan comic needs to conquer the open mic scene! Tired of scrambling to find gigs that don’t require a marathon sprint or a time machine? The CBAM Spot Hopper is here to plan your perfect evening of 3-6 mics, keeping you close to the action (think East Village to Midtown hops) with enough buffer to avoid those dreaded "I missed my slot!" moments. It’s like having a manager who’s always on time and never steals your punchlines.

This MVP is built for comics juggling day jobs or recovering from last night’s late set. Input your start time (say, 4 PM), pick a spot like Union Square, and let the app chain gigs faster than you can say "Is this thing on?"—all in ~2 seconds. Plus, whip up snappy outreach emails to bookers and skip venues that didn’t vibe (one-time, a week, or forever with a polite nudge later). Your data? Locked tighter than a comedy club’s drink minimum, with encryption that’d make a hacker cry.

🎭 What’s It Do?





Plan Your Night: Chain 3-6 open mics in Manhattan (e.g., St. Marks, Grisly Pear, PIT) for August 3, 2025, starting when you’re free (post-day job or coffee run). Walk or subway only, with 15-min buffers to keep things chill.



Outreach Magic: Generate emails/DMs to bookers in ~0.5s, like “Hey, can I grab a 5-min slot at West Side?”—editable so you sound like you, not a robot.



Skip the Meh: Don’t love a venue? Skip it for one night, a week, or forever (with a 30-day “miss me yet?” reminder).



Fast & Secure: Plans in ~2-3s, encrypted data (AES-256), no sharing without consent. MFA’s on hold for now to keep it easy (coming in version 3!).
